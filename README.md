# OSResources
Teaching materials covering bootloading, kernel functionality and system calls.

## Credit:
Code examples for barebones kernel and multiboot header taken largely from https://forum.osdev.org/index.php?sid=6f68fb1074946ae9986ff4d119efc255
## Contribution:
I added some extra documentation and comments to help make sense of resources
Includes example showing parallel between a basic print function and the sys_call equivalent written in Intelx86 assembly.
